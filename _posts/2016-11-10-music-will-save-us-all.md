Trump just won. Unexpected. Sad. Feeling the world nosediving in darkness. But music will save us all. Trump is just a puppet. Appealing to all those who want a break. Appealing to those who live on hope. He's just a man. Delured yes, but just a man. How's he gonna break all of us? Just a man really. Although most powerful now. But music will save him too.

I was surprised first. Then really waiting for shock to come in. It never did. We are our world. We want a Trump. You want it. I want it. We're not rational really. My mind cries. My heart hopes. But somewhere deep, we're all in for it. Trump's just a man. Brexit's just a word. They hurt, yes. But we want them. We live by them. We crave for change. Middle finger to all. We're lost in life. But we've got music. Now. Hope sings in our hears. We live. We feel. It will save us.
