Watched Crash from Paul Haggis. Felt thick to my stomach all throughout the movie. It’s one of those movies that moved me to the core through its depiction of xenophobia as a human mechanism to cope.

The soundtrack is haunting. It placed me in a state of such anxiety that I physically responded with tears and tremors. Actors are outstanding from the bad cop/good cop Matt Dillon to even the smallest characters.

I liked the fact that it does not try to be accurate as a realistic depiction of life but rather convey brilliantly a message through emotional illustrations. Yes we are all in our own ways subject to deep adverse reactions when confronted to people who do not ressemble us. Yet we embrace those racist feelings and actions not as gratuitous acts but rather as a means to keep balance and control in our own lives, possibly destroying those of others. There is no remedy to this, other than to acknowledge that this a profoundly human behavior and that we cannot position ourselves as all-knowing judges of the behavior of others.
