## me
Hi. I'm Victor. I live currently in Jakarta, Indonesia. I'm passionate about software but my family comes first. I'm currently on a break to raise my two kids: the youngest is learning to scribble on the wall, the oldest is starting to read. When I'm not changing diapers, I write code. It's hard to find the right balance between kids and code, but I aim to develop my skills at both.

## I've got a blog
If you look further, you might read a few things I wrote since I was in college. Mostly personal stuff, random thoughts and the occasional rumbling. Don't look for something structured or meaningful, it's mostly a fragmented piece of myself hanging out in the interwebs. I keep it there because I'm sentimental and I wish to dedicate more time to blogging in the future. By the way, I'm french, so if some of it sounds french to you, well that's normal.

## Things I love
- Quiet. I love quiet. And music. This is what saves my soul. Leave me alone for a few hours, I'll love you for it.
- AI. I'm fascinated by it. I never stepped seriously into it, don't know why really. Seems that AI is becoming a reality during this era. I'd love to be part of it.
- Coffee. I need it. Every day. Please.
- The web. I've been on it since 56k modems. It's my favorite lego box.
- My family. My wife. My kids. But hey you've got that already.

## Things I fear
- Humans. We're so fucked up. One of my biggest fear and my biggest hope at the same time.
- Javascript. Yep. It's a monster. Between us, it's love and hate. But I'm working on our relationship and it's getting better now.
