# About me

Hi. I'm Victor. I live currently in Clermont-Ferrand, France. I'm passionate about software but my family comes first. Got three kids: the youngest is starting to read, the oldest is almost ready to backpack its way through the world. I used to write code for a living and mostly for fun. It's hard to find the right balance between kids and code, but I aim to develop my skills at both.

If you look further, you might read a few things I wrote since I was in college. Mostly personal stuff, random thoughts and the occasional rumbling. Don't look for something structured or meaningful, it's mostly a fragmented piece of myself hanging out in the interwebs. I keep it there because I'm sentimental and I wish to dedicate more time to blogging in the future. By the way, I'm french, so if some of it sounds french to you, well that's normal.

I'd love hearing from you! If you want to share something on your mind or ask me a question, please send me an email at **jarbouvic at gmail dot com**.

### Things I love
- Quiet. I love quiet. And music. This is what saves my soul. Leave me alone for a few hours, I'll love you for it.
- AI. I'm fascinated by it. I never stepped seriously into it, don't know why really. Seems that AI is becoming a reality during this era. I'd love to be part of it.
- Coffee. I need it. Every day. Please.
- The web. I've been on it since 56k modems. It's my favorite lego box.
- My family. My wife. My kids. But hey you've got that already.

### Things I fear
- Humans. We're so fucked up. One of my biggest fear and my biggest hope at the same time.
- Javascript. Yep. It's a monster. Between us, it's love and hate. But I'm working on our relationship and it's getting better now.
